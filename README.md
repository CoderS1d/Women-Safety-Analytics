# SheShield

Womenâ€™s safety is a growing concern worldwide, and technology can play a critical role in building proactive solutions. This project leverages **computer vision, geospatial analysis, and machine learning** to detect potential threats in real time and highlight unsafe regions, supporting data-driven safety initiatives.

##  Features

* **Real-Time Detection**: Multi-model pipeline for person detection, gender classification (via OpenCV), gesture recognition (via MediaPipe Holistic), and anomaly detection.
* **Geospatial Heatmaps**: Incident-prone regions visualized using **Folium** and clustering techniques to identify high-risk zones.
* **Anomaly Detection**: Autoencoder models fine-tuned to detect unusual or unsafe activities with improved accuracy.
* **Holistic Framework**: Integration of CV, geospatial analytics, and ML insights into a unified pipeline for actionable safety analytics.
